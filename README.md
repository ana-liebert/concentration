## Gameplay

* The game starts with 12 blank cards on the screen, which contain 6 matches of various items- color, or shape, or symbol 
* When the page loads, the cards are shuffled to be in random order
* The objective of the game is to find all matches in the deck by selecting them one after the other, in the shortest amount of clicks and time
* User must select cards to reveal which item they contain, and look for matches. Cards will show the item as clicked, but disappear as the user continues to click on other cards 
* Once they've found a match, the card items will not disappear. When all matches have been found, all cards in the deck will show their item
* A timer will show the user's time, and a counter will show how many clicks it took them to match the cards. The user can shuffle the cards to play again and try to beat their score
